Crosstrained using "efficientnet_b5". Training got 
cut off so it might not be accurate. 

line 65 of `transfer_learning.py` also does not match 
the pixel `model_image_size_map` of `efficientnet_b5`
so that might somehow effect the accuracy 

Line 65
```python 
pixels = model_image_size_map.get(model_name, 224)
```
Line 45ish
```
"efficientnet_b5": 456,
```
