# APDL_Quality_Control
This project is intended to help with the quality control process of manufacturing chipsets. 

## Required features of this application/model 
- Augment existing datasets 
- Train model on augmented dataset to detect the presence of errors 
- More specifically we want it to detect the presence/absence of broken wires 
    - Save trained models
    - Deploy trained models in an application setting
