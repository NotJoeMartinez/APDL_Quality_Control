# image_diff
This project is intended to help with the quality control process of manufacturing chipsets. I originally started 
using an image majick python function to compare similar images but that was insufficient as it did not allow 
any room for small deviations which would be needed in the production environment. 


I've now moved to using machine learning to attempt to solve this problem see more 
in the `outlier_with_alibi` directory.
